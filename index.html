      Discord is an App you can chat on with ur friends and with unknown people too if you want. You can also create servers on it which are a better version of groups and chat with your friends. Discord is meant to use for gaming, school groups and many other things as it has much more feature than WhatsApp by FaceBook, Google Hangouts, Snapchat, etc. I will be talking about the features in depth in the next paragraph.

      Now lets talk about the features in discord.
      </p>
    <p>
      1. In discord you can make servers which are like groups but a billion trillion centimillion times better. You can organize the server by creating channels and categories. Thare are 3 kinds of channel which are Announcement Channels, Voice Channels and Text Channels. You can also add roles like manager, admin or or create your own. You can add ur own server emojis and us your servers for clubs, gaming, projects, normal chat, team, ngo's, etc. But discord is mainly meant for gaming, well thats what it was created for and they just changed it recently.
      </p>
    <p>
      2. You can join public servers and then make friends through the server. By making good discord servers and using your creativity you can make your server famous and become famous yourself.
      </p>
    <p>
      3. You can react to messages using Normal and animated emojis. You can also edit your message.
      </p>
    <p>
     4.You can use discord to talik with your friends while playing games because the games do not have good voice chat quality and only a few of them have voice chat. So you could use discord which has 10 times better audio quality and 1% chance of glitches.
    </p>
    <p>
      5.There are many other features but once you all download discord, you all could find out and explore it by yourself.
